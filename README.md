# 19EBPI_StatisticalConsulting
This is a statistical consulting project (Mar 2019 - Jun 2019) for clinicians from Department of Biostatistics of the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention of University of Zurich. The clinical trial was a retrospective study from University Hospital Zurich.

## Summary
Lung transplantation (LTx) is an established therapy in selected patients with advanced cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Resumption of employment after LTx is generally supported. In Switzerland, there is no data on long-term employment in people with CF undergoing LTx.

To evaluate the work participation after lung transplantation, I investigated both work status and average of work percentage at each time period: one year, three years, five years, ten years after lung transplantation and the end of the study.

*Mixed effect models* were used for *longitudinal data analysis*.
